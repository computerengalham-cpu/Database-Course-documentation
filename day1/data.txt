| Feature             | Flat File Systems                                                              | Relational Databases                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**       | Data stored in plain text files, CSVs, or spreadsheets. No enforced structure. | Data stored in tables with rows and columns. Schema defines structure. |
| **Data Redundancy** | High redundancy—data often duplicated across files.                            | Low redundancy—normalization reduces duplication.                      |
| **Relationships**   | No built-in relationships; linking data requires manual logic.                 | Strong relationship support using primary and foreign keys.            |
| **Example Usage**   | Log files, simple configuration files, small Excel lists.                      | Business applications, banking, e-commerce, ERP systems.               |
| **Drawbacks**       | Hard to update, low security, no concurrency control, prone to inconsistency.  | Requires DBMS knowledge, more resource-intensive.                      |

DBMS Advantages Mind Map

Security
Access control, authentication, encryption.

Integrity
Enforces rules to maintain accurate and consistent data.

Backup
Automatic backups and recovery support.

Redundancy Control
Normalization avoids duplicate data.

Concurrency
Multiple users can access data simultaneously without conflict.

Data Sharing
Centralized storage enables controlled sharing among users.



q3:
Roles in a Database System
System Analyst

Responsible for gathering requirements, analyzing business processes, and defining system specifications.

Database Designer

Creates conceptual, logical, and physical database designs including ERDs and schema diagrams.

Database Developer

Implements the database structure, writes SQL queries, stored procedures, and optimizes performance.

DBA (Database Administrator)

Handles security, backups, performance tuning, maintenance, monitoring, and access control.

Application Developer

Builds software applications that interact with the database through APIs or queries.

BI Developer

Develops dashboards, reports, and analytics systems using warehouse and OLAP tools.

q4:
Types of Databases
*Relational Databases

-Store data in tables.

-Use SQL.

-Enforce relationships.

Examples: SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL.

*Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases

-Flexible schemas.

-Key-value, document, graph, or column-based.

Examples:

MongoDB – Document store

Cassandra – Column-family store

*Centralized Databases

-Located on a single server.

-Easier to manage, but has a single point of failure.

*Distributed Databases

-Data spread across multiple nodes/locations.

-More scalable and fault-tolerant.

*Cloud Databases

-Hosted and managed by cloud providers.

-Pay-as-you-go with automatic scaling.

Examples: Azure SQL, Amazon RDS, Google Cloud Spanner.

Use Case Examples

Relational: Banking, HR systems

NoSQL: Social media feeds, IoT data

Distributed: Global e-commerce platforms

Cloud: SaaS apps, startups scaling quickly

q5:
Cloud Storage and Databases
What is Cloud Storage?

A service that stores data on remote servers accessed over the internet (e.g., Azure Blob Storage).

Relation to Databases

Cloud databases run on cloud infrastructure, using cloud storage for persistence.

Advantages of Cloud Databases:

-Automatic backups

-High availability

-Scalability

-Reduced hardware cost

Disadvantages:

-Ongoing subscription cost

-Dependence on internet

-Potential latency

-Vendor lock-in

q6:
Database Engines and Languages
What is a Database Engine?

The underlying software that manages storage, querying, transactions, and indexing.

Examples and Languages
| Engine     | Language       |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| SQL Server | T-SQL          |
| Oracle     | PL/SQL         |
| MySQL      | SQL (ANSI)     |
| PostgreSQL | SQL + PL/pgSQL |

Relationship Between Engine & Language

-Each engine has its own extensions but supports standard SQL to some degree.

Can One Language Work Across Engines?

-Basic SQL works across engines.

-Advanced features (triggers, functions, stored procedures) require engine-specific syntax.

q7:
Can We Transfer a Database Between Engines?
Is It Possible?

Yes, database migration is possible between engines like SQL Server → MySQL or Oracle → PostgreSQL.

Challenges:

-Different data types

-SQL dialect differences

-Stored procedure incompatibility

-Trigger/constraint variations

-Performance tuning differences

What to Consider Before Transferring:

-Data type mappings

-Rewriting stored procedures

-Rebuilding triggers

-Testing queries for performance

-Ensuring application compatibility

q8:
Logical vs Physical Schema
Logical Schema:

-Abstract design of the database.

-Defines entities, attributes, and relationships.

-Does not depend on any DBMS.

Physical Schema:

-How the data is stored on disk.

-Includes indexes, partitions, file groups, storage formats.

Difference:

-Logical = “What data looks like.”

-Physical = “How data is stored.”

Example: Student Entity
Logical Schema (ERD-like)
Entity: Student
Attributes:
- StudentID
- FirstName
- LastName
- Email
- CourseID (FK)
Physical Schema (SQL Script Example)
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(100),
    LastName VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(255),
    CourseID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Course(CourseID)
);
